# S49_Daniel_OOP_DYOS

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

The "Sneaker Design" project, developed using C++, will implement a console-based application that emphasises Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application will simulate the management and creation of various sneaker designs, each with unique attributes such as brand, model, colour, size, and price. Key OOP concepts incorporated in the system include classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
